This code can be tested using:

`npm run letters -- healthcare`
`npm run numbers -- 5 6 9 12 15`

## letters

Given for any string of any length, return a list of permutations (order matters) of all only 3 letter strings that have no repeated characters and no repeated permutation.

healthcare

hea
hel
het
car
cae

(not acceptable)

hee
haa
hth

*NOTE*: I assume that when you say "order matters," you would want "hea" but not "hae," since "a" appears after "e".

1. What is the alogrithm's big 0 notation for your solution?

O(n^2)

2. What are some options for looping that you have done for code?

I am not entirely sure what you meant by "options for looping done for code." If you mean different ways of looping, they are as follows:

* `for ... of` to go through the characters in the string. This is because a JavaScript string is not an array, else I would use `forEach`.
* Two nested `for` loops in `generatePermutations`, which are used to go through the array of possible letters to create the permutation strings.
* A `forEach` through the array of unique letters when generating the permutations.

## numbers

Create a method that will take in an array of integers and replace each number in the array with the product of all the numbers in the array except the number at the index itself.

1. What is the alogrithm's big 0 notation for your solution?

O(n)

2. What are some options for looping that you have done for code?

Assuming you mean types of loops, I used

* `Array.map` to convert the input array to numbers and to transform the input array
* Array destructuring with a concatenation of `Array.slice` operations to get the array with the current number missing
* `Array.reduce` to do the multiplication operation on the remaining numbers

3. What was the result for [5, 6, 9, 12, 15]?"

[ 9720, 8100, 5400, 4050, 3240 ]
